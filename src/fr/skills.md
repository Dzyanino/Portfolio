# Skills

> The sharpy weapons that I'm confident with.

## Programming tools

### Front-end

* `Vue 3` + `Vite`

> the ones that I'm the most skilled with, and what I use as a main option when developing Web applications, as they are powerfull, efficient and easy to learn.

* `Vuetify 3`

> Incredibly progressive Vue.js component library.

* `VitePress`

> Just got started with it for building Static Websites (this portfolio as an example).

* `TypeScript`

> Got started with it recently too, but thanks to `Javascript`, the learning phase was shorter than expected.

* `PyQt`

> Qt library for Python

* `CSS3` `SCSS` `SASS` `Bootstrap 5`

> CSS frameworks and Pre-processors

### Back-End

* `Node`

> Javascript plateform tool based on the `V8` Engine

* `Express`

> A Node.js framework for server routing endpoint. By far the best that I used, coming along with `Nodemon`.

* `Sequelize`

> An Object-Relational-Mapping or ORM for making database requests, and querying data using Models and Controllers.

* `Laravel`

> A PHP framework for building full-stack application with ease, thanks to its built-in ORM `Eloquent`, and the `Blade` views.

* `Python 3`

> Scripted and interpreted language for almost everything. Really powerfull and versatile.

* `Java`

> An Object language for building cross-plateform applications.

* `C#`

> Microsoft's next step after C++ for making desktop applications with `.DOT Net` and web ones with `.ASP Net`.

* `SQL`

## DBMS

* `PostgreSQL`

> A free, open source and mostly the best Database Management System in the world.

* `MySQL` `MariaDB`

> MySQL is Oracle's paid DBMS, and MariaDB it's forked and free version.

## Virtualization tools

* `Virtual Box`

> A free software for virtualizing operating systems and more.

* `GNS 3`

> For virtualizing network and more.

## Containerization

* `Docker`

> A tool for managing, shipping container and deploying services around the world with Cloud computing.

## Still needs improvements

While keeping to follow the progressive way, those are actually what I seem to lack, based on critics and reviews, and that I'm trying to overcome

* `UI/UX`

>> My UIs aren't that intuitive

* `Bigger projects`

>> Need to make or take part of bigger projects, even if it's personal
